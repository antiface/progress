A user may write:

```
    p add -t "title of the step/ticket/task"
```

All tickets are collected in progress.txt.

Information about them is saved in progress.yaml.

When a user enters just `p` all tickets are shown in the following format:

    id - title
        id - title 
    id - title 
    id - title 
        id - title 
        id - title 

Id is in alphanumeric format, automatically generated.

To add a substep to a ticket one make the following command:

```
    p add id.id.id -t "title of the subticket for item id.id.id, it will have id id.id.id.id"
```

File `progress.info.yaml` is not used. Information about last ticket id is saved into `progress.yaml` as the first item.
